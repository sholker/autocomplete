# Autocomplete
#### AutoComplite is a Python Script that provides an easy-to-use autocomplete feature for text input fields in Python applications.
----
This a Python script that imports a triNode class from a module named tree. It defines a function add_2_tree_from_file to read a list of words from a file or from a provided list, and then adds each word to a trie data structure represented by an instance of the triNode class (q). Finally, it prompts the user to enter an input string and prints the autocomplete suggestions based on the trie structure.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of your code does:

- It imports the triNode class from a module named tree.
- It initializes a trie node q.
- It defines a function add_2_tree_from_file that takes a filename as input, reads words from the file (or a list if provided), and adds each word to the trie.
- It checks if the input filename is a list or a file, reads the contents accordingly, and adds each word to the trie.
- It defines a main block that sets the filename, calls add_2_tree_from_file function to populate the trie, prompts the user to input a string, and prints the autocomplete suggestions based on the trie structure.

Please note the following points about the code:

The triNode class and its methods, such as add_2_tree, are assumed to be defined in the tree module.
There seems to be a typo in the function name complite, it's likely intended to be complete.
